Command and argument description:

- `docker run`    - run docker image
- `--rm`          - automatically remove the container when it exits
- `-i`            - keep STDIN open even if not attached
- `-t`            - allocate a pseudo-TTY
- `-v $PWD:/src`  - mount your current working directory to /src inside container
